Using [`echopype`](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype) as a base to deal with the raw files

Working to integrate glider datastreams for processing

Use bottom and shoal detection algorithms from [`echopy`](https://github.com/open-ocean-sounding/echopy). Must be installed using pip (`pip install echopy`)
